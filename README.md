# Ecoloops – Creating the Sustainability Loop with Walmart
Empowering conscious shopping decisions and rewarding responsible recycling.

## *🌿 What is EcoLoops?*
EcoLoops is a two-part sustainability solution integrated into Walmart’s website and app:


### 1️. EcoTrack

* Displays Sustainability Scores on product pages
* Shows carbon footprint, recyclability, ethical sourcing
* Suggests greener alternatives


### 2️. Waste-to-Wallet

* Lets customers return packaging, electronics, or clothing for recycling
* We schedules the pickup as our convenience
* Customers earn reward points added to their Walmart Wallet


## *🎯 Problem Statement*

- Customers want to shop sustainably but lack transparency about product impact.
- Post-purchase, there’s no easy, rewarding way to recycle packaging or used products.


## *💡 Our Solution*

* EcoTrack: Make informed eco-friendly choices before purchase.
* Waste-to-Wallet: Return recyclable items post-purchase and earn rewards.
